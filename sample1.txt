I'm too lazy to check the inputs to my slope calculation. 
Please don't let x be zero, 
I'll force you to eat a guiro. 
It'll crash the game, 
You'll hate git blame.
And you'll be compared to Emperor Nero. 

Darn C++ !!
Will this machine ever halt? 
Filled with code, nothing occult.
I made it compile.
(it took a short while)
But all that I got was a segfault.
