A man named Dave 
There once was a man named Dave, 
who thought he would try to be brave. 
He touched my code 
and made it explode 
so now he is in a mass grave. 

I'm too lazy to check the inputs to my slope calculation. 
Please don't let x be zero, 
I'll force you to eat a guiro. 
It'll crash the game, 
You'll hate git blame 
And you'll be compared to Emperor Nero. 

Darn C++ 
Will this machine ever halt? 
Filled with code, nothing occult 
I made it compile 
(it took a short while) 
But all that I got was a segfault
